# Auto-Strafes-For-Games-With-Locked-Cursor

Auto Bunny Hop and Auto Strafes for games that lock the cursor, such as Roblox Evade.

First, you need to run the executable file located at: Raw\x64\Debug\Raw.exe 
Only after that should you start Evade_Main.ahk

Pressing Shift toggles autorun on and off.
Holding the space bar enables auto jump.
While in auto jump mode, the script detects your mouse movements and automatically presses the "A" or "D" keys, depending on the direction of your mouse movement.
Ground strafing is also supported (when you are not holding the space bar but autorun is active, it will spam the A and D keys)
