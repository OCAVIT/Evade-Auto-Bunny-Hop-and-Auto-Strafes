# Auto Bunny Hop & Auto Strafes for Roblox Evade (and similar games)

This repository contains open and license-free scripts designed to automate advanced movement in Roblox Evade and other games that lock the mouse cursor.

ALL KEY FEATURES:
# Auto Bunny Hop:
Automatically jumps for you when you hold the space bar.

# Auto Strafes:
Mouse-based strafing: When holding space, the script detects your mouse movement and presses A or D accordingly.

# Ground Strafing:
Ground strafing: When autorun is active and space is not held, the script alternates A and D for you.

# Auto Run:
Shift toggles autorun

# AutoJump:
Space enables auto jump and mouse strafing.

# How to start files correctly?:
First, you need to run the executable file located at: Raw\x64\Debug\Raw.exe
Only after that should you start EVADE_MAIN.ahk

You should not close the Raw.exe window while playing; just minimize it. During the game, two files must be running in parallel for proper operation: EVADE_MAIN.ahk and Raw.exe

# For those who don't know how to download
Click "Code"->"Download ZIP"->Unzip to any empty folder

my Ahk was version 1.1.36.2

Works in Games with Locked Cursor:
The scripts are specifically made for games like Roblox Evade, where the mouse cursor is locked and standard AHK solutions donâ€™t work.
